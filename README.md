A fork with minimal changes to the original, only a single class and no other methods was removed or marked `@Gwt-Incompatible`. 

- `BigDecimalMathTest` has been adapted into a j2cl unit test. Long running & multi-threaded tests have been simplified or removed.
- `DefaultBigDecimalMath` has been removed due to ThreadContext usage.
- The core project has been kept, other support modules have been removed.
- build.gradle files replaced with maven POM.
